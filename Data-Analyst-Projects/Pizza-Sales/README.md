\## 📌 Business Problem



The company lacked a consolidated analytical view of its pizza sales data, making it difficult to:



\- Track crucial sales KPIs  

\- Identify daily and monthly trends for staffing and inventory planning  

\- Understand customer preferences across pizza categories and sizes  

\- Detect top and low-performing pizzas to guide product and marketing strategy  



Without these insights, decision-making was fragmented and heavily intuition-based.



This project solves that gap by building a complete analytics dashboard that centralizes KPIs, trends, and product-level performance to support data-driven decisions.
