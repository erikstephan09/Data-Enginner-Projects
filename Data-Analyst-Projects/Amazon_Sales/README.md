## 📝 Project Summary

This project analyzes year-to-date (YTD) and quarter-to-date (QTD) sales performance using \*\*SQL\*\* for data extraction, transformation, and aggregation, and \*\*Power BI\*\* for building an interactive dashboard.  

The solution delivers a complete view of sales trends, product performance, and customer engagement through KPIs and advanced data visualizations.



By combining SQL data modeling with Power BI reporting, stakeholders can quickly identify trends, top products, category performance, and customer sentiment—enabling better decisions in sales, marketing, and inventory management.

## 📌 Business Problem

The company struggles to effectively monitor \*\*sales performance, product movement, and customer satisfaction\*\* throughout the year. Business teams lack a consolidated view that allows them to:



- Identify \*\*sales trends\*\* across YTD, QTD, monthly, and weekly periods  

- Detect \*\*top-performing products\*\* that generate the most revenue  

- Evaluate \*\*customer satisfaction\*\* through product reviews  

- Compare \*\*category-level performance\*\* for marketing and inventory strategy  



This lack of visibility prevents truly data-driven decision-making.  

To solve this, a Power BI analytics dashboard was built with KPIs for YTD Sales, QTD Sales, YTD Products Sold, and YTD Reviews—along with visualizations that reveal trends, risks, and opportunities.
